 --help (-h)     - prints (this) basic description of the command line utility.

 --version       - prints the version info of the JBoss AS release, JVM and
                   system environment.

 --controller    - the default controller (including protocol, host and port)
                   to connect to when the --connect option (described below) is
                   specified or when the connect command is issued w/o
                   the arguments.
                   The default controller host is localhost and the port is 9990.
                   For more details on specifying the target controller
                   please execute 'help connect'.

 --connect (-c)  - instructs the CLI to connect to the controller on start-up
                   (to avoid issuing a separate connect command later).

 --gui           - GUI built on top of the CLI, the only difference is that it
                   brings up a GUI instead of a command line. In this mode, the
                   CLI will automatically connect during start-up. You can
                   optionally specify --controller, if necessary.

 --file          - specifies a path to a file which contains commands and
                   operations (one per line) that should be executed (in a
                   non-interactive mode). The CLI will terminate the session
                   immediately after the last command has been executed or if
                   some command or operation failed.

 --command       - specifies a single command or an operation that should be
                   executed in the CLI session. The CLI will terminate the
                   session immediately after the command or the operation has
                   been executed. Note: --command argument is optional in a
                   sense that any word (or phrase without whitespaces in it)
                   will be assumed to be a command (or an operation).

 --commands      - specifies a comma-separated list (the list must not contain
                   whitespaces) of commands and operations that should be
                   executed in the CLI session. The CLI session will be
                   automatically terminated as soon as the last command or
                   operation has been executed or after the first error. Note:
                   --commands argument is optional in a sense that any
                   comma-separated list at the end of the argument list will be
                   assumed to be the list of commands and operations.

 --error-on-interact  - disable prompts for security related input (username,
                        password, acceptance of unrecognized certificates) in
                   non-interactive mode. In case the argument is preset and an
                   input is required to proceed, the CLI process will terminate
                   abruptly with an error.

 --user (-u)     - if the controller requires user authentication, this argument
                   can be used to specify the user name as a command line
                   argument. If the argument isn't specified and the
                   authentication is required the user will be prompted to enter
                   the user name when the connect command is issued.  Local 
                   authentication is automatically disabled if a user is specified.

 --password (-p) - specifies the password for authentication while connecting to
                   the controller as a command line argument. If the argument
                   isn't specified and the authentication is required the user
                   will be prompted to enter the password when the connect
                   command is issued.

 --properties    - specifies a path to a properties file which contains
                   property value pairs to define system properties.
                   The properties file uses a standard KEY=VALUE syntax.

 --no-local-auth - disable the local authentication mechanism which allows the CLI
                   to demonstrate that it is being executed locally to the server 
                   being managed through an exchange of tokens using the filesystem.

 --timeout       - specifies how many milliseconds to wait for a given command
                   to return. The value provided must be a positive integer.
                   Defaults to 5000 milliseconds when not provided.

 --bind          - specifies to which address the CLI is going to be bound.
                   If none is provided then the CLI will choose one automatically as needed.

 --echo-command  - include the prompt with the command into the output 
                   for each command executed in non-interactive mode.

 --command-timeout  - The maximum amount of seconds the CLI will wait for a 
                      command to complete.
