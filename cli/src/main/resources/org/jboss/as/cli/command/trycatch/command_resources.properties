catch.description=Starts the catch block in the try-catch-finally control flow.

end-try.description=Ends and executes a try-catch-finally control flow.

finally.description=Starts the finally block in the try-catch-finally control flow.

try.description=\
Starts a try-catch-finally control flow. Each block, i.e. try, catch and finally, \
is executed as a separate batch. Which means if any of the commands or operation \
from the corresponding block fails then the whole block is rolled back.\n\
\n\
First try block is executed. The catch block, if present, is executed only if the \
try block fails. I.e. if the response of try comes with outcome "failed". If the \
was a java.io.IOException then the error is thrown immediately w/o executing catch \
or finally. The finally block, if present, is executed always.\n\
\n\
Unlike Java, there can only be one catch block. While both catch and finally \
blocks are optional, there must be at least one of them following try.\n\
\n\
The control flow is ended with end-try command which will execute it.
