embed.description=\
Main Command for embedded servers.

embed.host-controller.description=\
Launches an embedded host controller in the CLI process.

embed.host-controller.option.jboss-home.description=\
Filesystem path pointing to the root directory of the installation from which \
the embedded host controller should run. Only available if the CLI itself is not \
running in a modular classloading environment. In a non-modular classloading \
environment, if this option is not specified, the value of the environment variable \
JBOSS_HOME will be used. Must be specified if the environment variable JBOSS_HOME \
is not set. In a modular classloading environment it is assumed the CLI is running from \
the host controller installation itself and the JBOSS_HOME environment variable \
must be set.

embed.host-controller.option.jboss-home.value=jboss root directory

embed.host-controller.option.domain-config.description=\
Name of the domain configuration file to use (default is "domain.xml")

embed.host-controller.option.domain-config.value=domain file

embed.host-controller.option.host-config.description=\
Name of the host configuration file to use (default is "host.xml")

embed.host-controller.option.host-config.value=host file

embed.host-controller.option.std-out.description=\
How to handle output to System.out from the embedded host controller. Legal \
values are "discard" and "echo". The "discard" value indicates that writes to \
System.out from the server should be discarded. The "echo" value means writes \
should be handled and appear as part of the CLI's own output to System.out. The \
default value is "discard". If "echo" is chosen and the CLI is running an \
interactive session, the user should recognize that asynchronous output from the \
server may interfere with the normal appearance of the CLI prompt.

embed.host-controller.option.std-out.value=discard|echo

embed.host-controller.option.timeout.description=\
Maximum time, in seconds, to wait for the host controller to reach a \
running (i.e. fully started) state once the embedded server is created. If \
unspecified, the command will block for as long as necessary, with no upper limit. \
If the value is less than 1, the command will return as soon as the embedded \
server has reached the point in its boot where it is manageable by the CLI.

embed.host-controller.option.timeout.value=num seconds

embed.server.description=\
Launches a standalone server embedded in the CLI process.

embed.server.option.admin-only.description=\
Whether the embedded server should be started in running mode "admin-only". \
The default is "true".

embed.server.option.admin-only.value=true|false

embed.server.option.empty-config.description=\
Indicates the server should start with an empty configuration. If the specified \
server config file is not empty, an exception will be thrown and the server will \
not start, unless the --remove-existing option is also set.

embed.server.option.empty-config.value=true|false

embed.server.option.jboss-home.description=\
Filesystem path pointing to the root directory of the installation from which \
the embedded host controller should run. Only available if the CLI itself is not \
running in a modular classloading environment. In a non-modular classloading \
environment, if this option is not specified, the value of the environment variable \
JBOSS_HOME will be used. Must be specified if the environment variable JBOSS_HOME \
is not set. In a modular classloading environment it is assumed the CLI is running from \
the host controller installation itself and the JBOSS_HOME environment variable \
must be set.

embed.server.option.jboss-home.value=jboss root directory


embed.server.option.remove-existing-config.description=\
When the --empty-config option is used, indicates that any existing configuration \
file can be removed at server start.

embed.server.option.remove-existing-config.vale=true|false

embed.server.option.server-config.description=\
Name of the server configuration file to use (default is "standalone.xml").

embed.server.option.server-config.value=server file

embed.server.option.std-out.description=\
How to handle output to System.out from the embedded host controller. Legal \
values are "discard" and "echo". The "discard" value indicates that writes to \
System.out from the server should be discarded. The "echo" value means writes \
should be handled and appear as part of the CLI's own output to System.out. The \
default value is "discard". If "echo" is chosen and the CLI is running an \
interactive session, the user should recognize that asynchronous output from the \
server may interfere with the normal appearance of the CLI prompt.

embed.server.option.std-out.value=discard|echo

embed.server.option.timeout.description=\
Maximum time, in seconds, to wait for the host controller to reach a \
running (i.e. fully started) state once the embedded server is created. If \
unspecified, the command will block for as long as necessary, with no upper limit. \
If the value is less than 1, the command will return as soon as the embedded \
server has reached the point in its boot where it is manageable by the CLI.

embed.server.option.timeout.value=num seconds

embed.stop.description=\
Stop the server (standalone or host controller) currently embedded in the CLI process.
