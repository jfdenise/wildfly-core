rollout-plans=Storage information about a set of named management update rollout plans useful to management clients that are stored in the domain content repository. The child resources under this resource provide access to these plans to management clients, allowing clients to use the plans by referencing them by name, avoiding the need to recreate them for each use.
rollout-plans.hash=The hash of all stored rollout plans. Used internally by host controllers to locate rollout plan content.
rollout-plans.add=Adds the capability to store named rollout plans.
rollout-plans.remove=Removes the capability to store named rollout plans.
rollout-plan=A stored rollout plan.
rollout-plan.hash=The hash of the rollout plan content.
rollout-plan.content=The rollout plan content, in JBoss DMR form.
rollout-plan.add=Adds a rollout plan to the persistent store.
rollout-plan.remove=Removes a rollout plan from the persistent store.
rollout-plan.store=Updates the content of an existing persisted rollout plan, after first checking that the provided 'hash' parameter matches the current rollout plan hash. Fails if the hashes do not match. Using this operation instead of the 'write-attribute' operation for the 'content' attribute provides a guarantee that the update will not conflict with a previous update unknown to the caller.
rollout-plan.store.hash=The value the caller believes to be the hash of the rollout plan content that is being replaced.
rollout-plan.store.content=The updated rollout plan content, in JBoss DMR form.

#scripts repository
scripts=Storage information about a set of named scripts.
scripts.hash=The hash of all stored scripts. Used internally by server to locate script content.
scripts.add=Adds the capability to store named scripts.
scripts.remove=Removes the capability to store named scripts.
script=A stored script.
script.hash=The hash of the script content.
script.content=The script content, in JBoss DMR form.
script.add=Adds a script to the persistent store.
script.remove=Removes a script from the persistent store.

checking that the provided 'hash' parameter matches the current script hash. \
Fails if the hashes do not match. Using this operation instead of the \
'write-attribute' operation for the 'content' attribute provides a guarantee \
that the update will not conflict with a previous update unknown to the caller.
